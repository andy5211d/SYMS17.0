The SYMS17.0 Control PCB (2000802731) used a number of gas boilers.   Includes details of some capacitors that may require changing and relevant voltages around the PCB.  Check your board as this is just my guess as to the details and circuit!  

This is an unregulated SMPS, in that there is NO feedback between the secondary voltages and the switcher drive.  The main LV DC is around 40V with the boiler quiescent, (note the smoothing capacitors for this are 35V working!), and during operation drops around 30V dependent upon fan speed.  The opto coupler U102 provides the controlling micro with the AC input and HV DC values, or at least that's my assumption from tracing tracks on the board!  

I have noticed at least three versions of the board but seem interchangeable in some boilers (see bottom left corner). Most variations are around the regulator U503 which new boards seem to omit or have been designed out of the layout.
